# Project 1: Transformations Jupyter

Use Colab to run the notebook

## How To Submit
For submission replace the cvfa21netid part of the directory with you netid. In my case, my netid is danielsawyer so the directory name would be danielsawyer_project-1.

The whole project should be contained within that directory. Then, zip the directory and only that directory and save it as netid_project-1.zip, where netid is replaced by your netid. In my case, it would be danielsawyer_project-1.zip

Here is an example tree of the directory structure
```
danielsawyer_project-1.zip contains...
